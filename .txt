After that when everything is done we will check for real time updates and then we will create a user page (not settings) so that the user could check his content(we search based on username) and retrive all posts he have sent to the other. I think we could just use the feed.  



Client

Inside the header we should create a settings page and then make it accessible for to LeftSide
LeftSide should be able to open the settings page, we could navigate to it ?


Server
When the image is too big 

We should build a logout route so that the user can login again

(
When we comment on a post then we shall search for it that post 
and then we should update the comment section(we create one inside the schema )
)
